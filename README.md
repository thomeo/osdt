# OpenStack Developer Tools
OpenStack Developer Tools will be a plugin for Eclipse that provides a suite of tools for OpenStack development that are integrated with the Eclipse IDE.



Its primary goal is to ease developing new and current drivers for the OpenStack components (Nova, Neutron, etc.). Obviously the plugin will be compatible with PyDev.
